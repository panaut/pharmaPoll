<h3>SURVEY ON THE UNMET NEEDS FOR PATIENTS LIVING WITH METASTATIC COLORECTAL CANCER (MCRC)</h3>
<h4 style="">
    I am writing to you on behalf of PatQue.net, a not-for-profit organization established in 2004, dedicated to saving lives from colorectal cancer. We are active with over 40 branches across the whole of Europe. With your help, we will try to improve conditions and treatments for other patients. As a patient who has experienced treatment and outcomes of metastatic colorectal cancer, I am asking you to complete the survey, based on your experience, to help others through their journey.
    This is the first survey of its kind and size and it took us more than 3 years to develop it. We will take your answers to our Governments, Policy Makers, Politicians, Health Ministries, Industry, Media and others to ask for changes to be made so the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer meet your needs.
    We need 1000 patients from 10 countries to complete this survey, but together with our Members, Clinicians and Nurses, we hope to reach this goal in 6 months.
    The questions will take up to 20 minutes of your time to complete. There is no right or wrong answer as you are the expert on your own health. We can send our findings to you if you leave your email address at the end of the survey.
    There are two parts to this survey – the first part has been developed by us, together with the help of 8 colorectal cancer patients in our Expert Patient Advisory Group (EPAG). The second half are the questions developed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC). Each of these two parts are equally important as they will help us to understand the unmet needs for patients like yourself.
    Thank you for taking the time to complete the survey.
